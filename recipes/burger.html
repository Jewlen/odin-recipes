                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef (for juicy burgers, 80/20 is good)</li>
                    <li>1 ounce dried mushrooms, such as porcinis or morels</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce    </li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
                    <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>4 to 6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
                    <li>Hamburger buns</li>
                </ul>
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Process the dried mushrooms:</li></h3>
                    In a food processor, or a clean coffee grinder (grind some raw rice to clean out coffee grinds), grind the dry mushrooms until they're a powder.<br> 
                    Remove any large mushroom pieces that didn't grind down, a few small pieces will be fine.
                    <h3><li>Make the burger mixture:</li></h3>
                    In a large bowl, use your clean hands to gently mix together the meat, salt, mushroom powder, black pepper and Worcestershire sauce.<br>
                    Mix just until everything is mostly combined. Do not overwork the meat mixture or it will become tough and meatloaf-like.
                    <h3><li>Form the patties:</li></h3>
                    Shape the meat into 3 to 4 patties, using about 1/4 to 1/3 pound pound per patty, creating a slight indentation at the centers of the patties<br>
                    (this will help keep the patties fairly flat when they cook, as the sides tend to contract more than the center).
                    <h3><li>Prepare the grill</li></h3>
                    Prepare your grill for high, direct heat. Place a cast iron skillet on grill grates so it heats along with the grill. (Alternatively, heat the skillet on the stovetop over high heat.)
                    <h3><li>Sauté the mushrooms, then the onions:</li></h3>
                    When the skillet is hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact, add the mushrooms and <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_cook_mushrooms_without_fat/">dry-sauté them</a> until they release their water, about 2-3 minutes.</p>

                    Add the onions and the olive oil, toss to combine and continue to sauté over high heat 1 minute. Add salt to taste and cook until the onions soften and begin to brown.<br> 
                    Remove the skillet from heat and transfer the mushrooms to a bowl.
                    <h3><li>Grill the burgers:</li></h3>
                    Place patties on high, direct heat and cook to the desired doneness, between 5-8 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the burgers and how hot your grill is.
                    <h3><li>Add the cheese:</li></h3>
                    When the burgers are almost done, lay the Swiss cheese over them and allow the cheese to melt.
                    <h3><li>Grill the buns:</li></h3>
                    Paint the burger buns with a little olive oil and toast them on the griddle or grill grates, about 1 to 2 minutes.
                    <h3><li>Assemble the burgers:</li></h3>
                    Place a burger on a bun and top with the sautéed onions and mushroom mixture.
