My Odin Recipe Website

By its completion, This website will have demonstrated my current understanding
off HTML, including but not limited too: Boilder-plate making, font markup,
project structure, lists, image insertion, and developer comments.

The goal of this project is to make a recipe website that contains a front 
show casing recipes that when clicked on, redirect to a subpage containing 
the recipe instructions.
